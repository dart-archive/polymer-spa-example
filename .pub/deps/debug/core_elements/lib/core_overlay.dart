/// The `core-overlay` element displays overlayed on top of other content. It starts
/// out hidden and is displayed by setting its `opened` property to true.
/// A `core-overlay's` opened state can be toggled by calling the `toggle`
/// method.
///
/// The `core-overlay` will, by default, show/hide itself when it's opened. The
/// `target` property may be set to another element to cause that element to
/// be shown when the overlay is opened.
///
/// It's common to want a `core-overlay` to animate to its opened
/// position. The `core-overlay` element uses a `core-transition` to handle
/// animation. The default transition is `core-transition-fade` which
/// causes the overlay to fade in when displayed. See
/// <a href="../core-transition/">`core-transition`</a> for more
/// information about customizing a `core-overlay's` opening animation. The
/// `backdrop` property can be set to true to show a backdrop behind the overlay
/// that will darken the rest of the window.
///
/// An element that should close the `core-overlay` will automatically
/// do so if it's given the `core-overlay-toggle` attribute. This attribute
/// can be customized with the `closeAttribute` property. You can also use
/// `closeSelector` if more general matching is needed.
///
/// By default  `core-overlay` will close whenever the user taps outside it or
/// presses the escape key. This behavior can be turned off via the
/// `autoCloseDisabled` property.
///
///     <core-overlay>
///       <h2>Dialog</h2>
///       <input placeholder="say something..." autofocus>
///       <div>I agree with this wholeheartedly.</div>
///       <button core-overlay-toggle>OK</button>
///     </core-overlay>
///
/// `core-overlay` will automatically size and position itself according to the
/// following rules. The overlay's size is constrained such that it does not
/// overflow the screen. This is done by setting maxHeight/maxWidth on the
/// `sizingTarget`. If the `sizingTarget` already has a setting for one of these
/// properties, it will not be overridden. The overlay should
/// be positioned via css or imperatively using the `core-overlay-position` event.
/// If the overlay is not positioned vertically via setting `top` or `bottom`, it
/// will be centered vertically. The same is true horizontally via a setting to
/// `left` or `right`. In addition, css `margin` can be used to provide some space
/// around the overlay. This can be used to ensure
/// that, for example, a drop shadow is always visible around the overlay.
